**Testing unconnected components**

- export intermediate components as Private, to avoid confusion when importing a \*component instead of \*container

---

**Display a react version**

`{React.version}`

---

**Short-circuit evaluation**

Is a method when the second expression is evaluated only after the first one is truthy.

`{ shouldUserSeePrice && <Price amount={30} currency="$" />`

---

**Use shallow props instead of objects**

`<Notification type="info" text="Item has been added." hideAfter={500} />`

instead of

`<Notification data={notification} hideAfter={500} />`

---


**A second argument to `this.setState`**

In order to avoid batching multiple `setState` calls, ensures proper ordering.

`this.setState( (prevState, currProps) => ({ isLoading: false }) );`

---

**Changing classes vs styles performance**

Because of performance, it's advisable to switch classes. There's no need to rerender a document, when you can rerender class names.

---

**Equivalent of anything that react acceps as a child**

`React.propType.node`

---

**Event delegation**

React listens on the entire document for a click events, then it sees the source of the event, and finally it delegates it (if the source element has the click handler, if not - the event bubbles until it founds a parent handler).

---


**User-defined components must be capitalized**

If you define a component that starts with a non-capitalized letter, React treats it as a built-in HTML tag e.g `div`.

Tags are used to mark up the start and the end of an HTML element.
Element is an opening tag, content and a closing tag.

---

**Hooks**

It's better to say "function components" instead of "stateless components".

Hooks don't work in the class components.

Call hooks at the top level - don't do it in conditions, loops, nested functions, or JS functions.

You can create a custom hook.

**useState**

You can pass whatever type of the default value. Not necessarily an object like in the class state. Null/undefined/number/string work too.

`const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);`

You can use multiple useState hooks in one component.

You can use `lazy evaluation` to pass an retrieve an initial value. Pass a function, that will be run only once, at the initial render. On the subsequent renders it won't be invoked.

`const [value, setValue] = useState(() => longOperation());`

You can Just Useâ„¢ hooks with TypeScript.

Test it just like any other component. Don't rely on implementation details.

**How to set type of props of the functional component?**

`const App: FC<{init: number}> = ({init}) => (<div />)`
or
```
type Props = {
  init: number
}
const App: FC<Props> = ({init}) => (<div/>);
```

---

**How to set type of props of the class component?**

`class App extends React.Component<{IProps, IState}> {}`

**Testing**

How can I get an element? These methods throw an error when element is not found.

By text, label, test id, placeholder.

```
const {getByText} = render(<App />);
getByText("score");
getByText(/score/i); // don't look at casing
```

---

**How to use data-testid?**

```
const App = () => <div data-testid="score">A</div>;

const {getByTestId} = render(<App />);

**How to fire a click event in r-t-l?**

```
const App = () => <button>Increment</button>;

const {getByText} = render(<App />);
cosnt button = getByText(/increment/i);
fireEvent.click(button);
```

---

**useReducer**

It's used by `useState` internally. 
`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)`

Reducer is a function with signature: `(state, action) => newState`.
You can use a standard switch statement.

```
type State = {
  count: number;
};

type Action = {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement' | 'reset';
};

const initialState: State = {
  count: 1
};

const reducer = (state: StateTypes, action: Action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {...state, count: state.count +1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {...state, count: state.count +1};
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

Or more of an object-based approach:

```
type State = {
  count: number;
};

type Reducers = {
  increment: ReducerFunction;
  decrement: ReducerFunction;
  reset: ReducerFunction;
};

type Actions = {
  type: keyof Reducers;
};

type ReducerFunction = (action?: Actions) => (state: State) => State;

const initialState: State = {
  count: 0;
};

const increment: ReducerFunction = () => R.evolve({count: R.inc});
const decrement: ReducerFunction = () => R.evolve({count: R.dec});
const reset: ReducerFunction = () => R.always(initialState);

const reducers: RT = {
  increment,
  decrement,
  reset,
};

const reducer = (state: State, action: Actions): State => reducers[action.type](action)(type);

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

To dispatch an action onClick:
`<button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'reset'})}>Increment</button>`

**Alternative syntax for React Fragment**

`const App: FC = () => (<>xxx</>);`

**Lazy load component with lazy and Suspense**

A component that we are going to lazy load. Remember about a default export.

```
// Header.jsx

import React, {FC} from 'react';

const Header: FC = () => <h2>XD</h2>;

export default Header;
```

```
// App.jsx

import React, {useState, FC, lazy, Suspense} from 'react';

const Header = lazy(() => import('./Header'));

const useToggle = (initialValue: boolean): [boolean, () => void] => {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(initialValue);
  const setToggle = () => setOn(!on);
  return [on, setToggle];
};

const App: FC = () => {
  const [showHeader, toggleHeader] = useToggle(false);
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        Header is shown:
        <strong>{JSON.stringify(showHeader)}</strong>
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => toggleHeader()}>Toggle</button>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {showHeader && <Header />}
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

**How to useEffect?**

It's a hook when you should perform all the side-effects.

You can think of it as a `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount` combined.

There are two kinds of side-effects. Those which require a cleanup and those which don't. 

We don't need to duplicate code/logic between lifecycles.

By default `useEffect` hook describes an operation that performs after the first render and on each update. React guarantees the DOM has been updated before the hook is run.

API:
`useEffect(() => { document.title = "xxx"; return () => {console.log("cleanup")} })`

On each render the function that is passed will be new. That's intentional, so we can access a current state etc. Each effect belongs to the particular render.

There are a lot of bugs coming from not handling a componentDidUpdate scenario.

To make React skip applying an effect, pass an array with variable that changes will be tracked. An empty array means that the effect will be applied on initial render and unmount.

Effects are run after React renders, ensuring that its not blocking any update.

---

**What happens when the key of the element changes?**

When an component's key has changed, React will unmount the component and mount a new instance of it.

```
function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      {counter}
      <button
        onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}
      >
        Add
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [key, setKey] = useState("default");
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Counter key={key} />
      {key}
      <button onClick={() => setKey('newone')}>
        Change key
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

**How to test components that utilize useEffect?**

After you render a component that performs some side effects within useEffect, and you want to see the results, you need to rerender it. Body passed to the useEffect hook is executed **after** the render is committed.

```
const {rerender} = render(<App />);
  rerender(<App />);
  expect(window.document.title).toEqual('Current name: <empty>');
```

**How to access document title in tests?**

`window.document.title`

**Why do we need to specify the type of event target?**

There can be many types of the event target, be it an element, xhr, audio context. So we need to explicitly cast the target to the specific type.

`const element = e.target as HTMLInputElement;`

---

**How to access a value of input in TypeScript?**

`const input = getByLabelText(/name/i) as HTMLInputElement;`

**How to fire "change" event in r-t-l?**

```
const input = getByLabelText(/name/i) as HTMLInputElement;
fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: "Johnny"}});
```

---

**How to test lazy-loaded components?**

Use `wait`/`waitForElement` async functions. The former runs the next event loop tick, and the latter uses a mutation observer to check if the callback doesn't throw an error.

We pass a promise to the React.lazy, so it will resolve in the next event loop tick, it's enough to `wait`.

**useEffect vs useLayoutEffect**

`useLayoutEffect`:
- aligned closer to the previous `componentDidMoun`/`componentDidUpdate`/`componentWillUnmount` behaviour
- run synchronously after all DOM mutations
- before user sees an update on the screen (DOM mutations)


`useEffect`
- run asynchronously after all DOM mutations
- after user sees an update on the screen (e.g store sun/unsub)

**How to type React component to allow more than one child?**

```
interface Props {
	children: React.ReactChild | React.ReactChild[];

---

**How and why to forwardRef?**

`ref` can only be passed to a native HTML element, like `input` or `button`. When passed to a Function Component, React warns that it won't work.

A way for a Function Component to receive a ref is to wrap it with `forwardRef`.

```
const Button = forwardRef((props, ref) => (<button {...props} ref={ref}>Buy</button>)
    )
```

With TypeScript, forwardRef receives two arguments: HTML element type and component props.

```
const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, HTMLProps<HTMLButtonElement>((props, ref) => (<button {...props} ref={ref}>Buy</button>)
    )
```

---

**How to clone all the children and pass props to them?**

```
{React.Children.map(this.props.children, child =>
  React.cloneElement(child, { isActive: this.state.isActive })
)}
```

---

**How to access DOM refs by `useRef`?**

```
const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null); // TS says that it needs to be initialized to some variable

<input ref={inputRef} />

An actual DOM ref is available in `inputRef.current`, before/after the input the ref refers to is mounted/unmounted, the value of the ref is equal to null.
```
