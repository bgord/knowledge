# Workflow in Todoist

I want to make it obvious when it comes to my task management system, because I used to spent way too much time thinking about all the possibilities to organize my todos.

1. Adding tasks

- when I come up with a task, I put it to the INBOX.

2. Inbox Review

- if a task is about to take up to 2 minutes, do it right away.
- if it's a new word/phrase, pass it to the `words` script

- otherwise, a task can land in one of the following projects:

  - Learning (green - new energy)
    - things I should learn about
    - research
    - grammar rules
  - Work (red - priority)
    - calls/meetings
    - tasks/subtasks
    - catchups
    - questions
  - Me (charcoal, day to day)
    - day-to-day activities
      - grocery
      - creating shopping lists
      - tidying
      - cleaning
      - washing dishes
    - formalities
    - charges I need to pay
    - buying things
    - planning travels
    - calls
  - Mentoring (lime green)
    - a task concerning helping other people
    - code reviews
  - Blog (berry red)
    - research
    - writing blog posts
  - Personal development (sky blue - to the sky!)
    - habits formation
    - figuring a better workflow
  - Coding (violet)
    - an open-source tasks
    - side projects

3. Each project should have an "energy level" label associated with it
- `high-energy` when a task makes me stressed and I know it'll be hard to take care of that
- `normal-energy` when a task doesn't make me stressed, but requires some time and energy
- `low-energy` when a task is easy & and can be done very quickly

Topics to cover:
- time labels
- reminders
- filter
