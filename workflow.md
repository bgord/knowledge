# Workflow in Todoist

I want to make it obvious when it comes to my task management system, because I used to spent way too much time thinking about all the possibilities to organize my todos.

1. When I come up with a task, I put it to the INBOX.

2. When it's time to review INBOX, a task can land in one of the following projects:

- Learning, when it's a thing I should learn about/research/check about
- Work, if it's strictly related to work (it's important to differentiate from the personal life project)
- Me, for a day-to-day activities, e.g shopping/formal issues/cleaning
- Mentoring, for the tasks concerning helping other people/code reviews
- Blog, for all the research and writing blog posts
- Personal development (habits, )
