# Workflow in Todoist

I want to make it obvious when it comes to my task management system, because I used to spent way too much time thinking about all the possibilities to organize my todos.

1. When I come up with a task, I put it to the INBOX.

2. When it's time to review INBOX, a task can land in one of the following projects:

- Learning
  - a thing I should learn about
  - research
- Work
  - calls/meetings
  - tasks/subtasks
  - catchups
  - questions
  - it's important to differentiate it from the personal life
- Me
  - day-to-day activities
    - grocery
    - tidying
    - cleaning
    - washing dishes
  - formalities
  - charges I need to pay
  - buying things
  - calls
- Mentoring
  - a task concerning helping other people
  - code reviews
- Blog
  - research
  - writing blog posts
- Personal development
  - habits formation
  - figuring a better workflow

Topics to cover:
- time labels
- reminders
- filter
