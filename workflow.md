# Workflow in Todoist

I want to make it obvious when it comes to my task management system, because I used to spent way too much time thinking about all the possibilities to organize my todos.

## Todoist

### Adding tasks

1. when I come up with a task, I put it to the INBOX.

2. Assigning projects to a task

- if a task is about to take up to 2 minutes, do it right away.
- if it's a new word/phrase, pass it to the `words` script

- otherwise, a task can land in one of the following projects:

  - Learning (green - new energy)
    - things I should learn about
    - research
    - grammar rules
  - Work (red - priority)
    - calls/meetings
    - tasks/subtasks
    - catchups
    - questions
  - Me (charcoal, day to day)
    - day-to-day activities
      - grocery
      - creating shopping lists
      - tidying
      - cleaning
      - washing dishes
    - formalities
    - charges I need to pay
    - buying things
    - planning travels
    - calls
  - Mentoring (lime green)
    - a task concerning helping other people
    - code reviews
  - Blog (berry red)
    - research
    - writing blog posts
    - potential blog post ideas
  - Personal development (sky blue - to the sky!)
    - habits formation
    - figuring a better workflow
  - Coding (violet)
    - OS tasks
    - side projects

3. Energy level labels.

Each project should have an "energy level" label associated with it, so it's easier to filter tasks that match my current mood. Feeling a bit under the weather? Choose a task with `low-energy` label. Otherwise, go for it, and do the most challenging things!

- `high-energy` when a task makes me stressed and I know it'll be hard to take care of that
- `normal-energy` when a task doesn't make me stressed, but requires some time and energy
- `low-energy` when a task is easy & and can be done very quickly

4. Time labels

A task can land into one of the following time labels, it's useful to see a possible timebox when planning a day or life :)

- `2-min`, very quick one - just a matter of searching, adding stuff etc.
- `5-min`
- `10-min`
- `15-min`
- `25-min`, a timespan of pomodoro session
- `60-min`
- `more-than-hour`, when you anticipate that it will take much time

5. @next-step label

It's one of the most important labels out there. It highlights the next action you need to take to achieve your goal.

Some advices:
- don't add @next-step to recurring tasks/habits
- assign it for every project at the end of the day
- it should have the highest priority
- it should be small enough to make me not run away from it

6. @waiting label

- when you're unable to take an action, because a task is dependent on another person, label it as @waiting
- remember to add a reason why it's not actionable
- try to regularly visit and remove this label when it's no longer applicable (during daily Todoist refinement)

### Refinement

1. Should happen everyday in the evening, and be quick (5 minutes).

2. Activities to perform:

- prioritize tasks for the next day
- move tasks from inbox and assign proper metrics
- add @next-step for one task in each project
- fix spellings and correct sentences

## Journal

1. Write after 20, in addition to the notes taken during the day.

2. Questions I want to answer
- What're the tasks done today that you're the most proud of?
- Are you feeling good right now?
- What are you grateful for?
- What's on your mind right now?
