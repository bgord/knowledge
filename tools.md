**Setup HCAPTCHA**

Go to the https://www.hcaptcha.com/ page and find two keys:

- HCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY: a secret key used to verify the hcaptcha response on the server
- HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY: a public key used to fetch hcaptcha challanges on the frontend

Install the `hcaptcha` package and create a backend middleware like this:

```js
const validata_hcaptcha_response = async (req, res, next) => {
  const { HCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY } = process.env;

  const hcaptcha_response_token = req.body.token;

  try {
    if (!hcaptcha_response_token) {
      throw new Error();
    }

    const hcaptcha_result = await hcaptcha.verify(
      HCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY,
      hcaptcha_response_token
    );

    if (hcaptcha_result.success) {
      return next();
    } else {
      throw new Error();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.json({
      status: 0,
      message: res.__("you_must_solve_a_captcha"),
    });
  }
};
```

On the frontend use a React/Vue/vanilla package.

**Create a mock sftp server**

```
docker run -v /tmp/upload:/home/ftp/upload -p 2222:22 -d atmoz/sftp ftp:pass:1000
```

After that, get the IP address of the container:

```
docker container ls
docker inspect <container-id> # look for NetworkSettings.IPAddress
```

Then, sftp to the server in the container, cd to the upload
directory and you're good to go. (Notice the way we avoid writing to
~/.ssh/known_hosts, which is a problem after you destroy and
recreate the container.)

```
$ sftp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o LogLevel=quiet ftp@172.17.0.2
password: pass

$ cd upload
```

`/tmp/upload` on your local machine is synced with `/home/ftp/upload` in the container.

**WebP**

Originates from WebM video codec.

WebM supports infra-frame compression - each frame is compressed, and then differences between frames are also compressed.

WebP is a single frame of WebM file.

WebP can be both lossy or lossless.

It takes a pixel and applies a range of predictions of what would adjacent pixels look like.
Then it applies sort of a Huffman encoding.

**Do nothing scripts**

The very first step in an attempt to automate a manual or semi-manual process.

**Convert wav to mp3**

```
$ ffmpeg -i input.wav -vn -ar 44100 -ac 2 -b:a 192k output.mp3

-i - input file

-vn - Disable video, to make sure no video (including album cover image) is included if the source would be a video file

-ar - Set the audio sampling frequency. For output streams it is set by default to the frequency of the corresponding input stream. For input streams this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options.

-ac - Set the number of audio channels. For output streams it is set by default to the number of input audio channels. For input streams this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options. So used here to make sure it is stereo (2 channels)

-b:a - Converts the audio bitrate to be exact 192kbit per second
