**Hyphen vs en dash vs e mdash**

`Hyphen` - is mostly used for word division, such as "two-way". Shouldn't be used in place of en/em dashes.

`En dash` – is mostly user for span or ranges of numbers "2012–2013", or connections "liberal–conservative" or "Los Angeles–London".

`Em dash`— can take place of commas, parentheses, or colons.

**Smart quotes vs dumb quotes**

Dumb quotes are the ones available straight from keyboard: "Harry Potter".
Smart quotes, however, are typographically correct: “Harry Potter”.

The main difference is in the curviness, and the fact that the opening and closing quotes are different.
