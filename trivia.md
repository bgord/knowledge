**What's a survivor bias?**

                       Successful people (visible) <- concentrating on them
People -> Selection ->
                       Unsuccessful people (barely visible)

Concentrating on people who went through a selection and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways.

Example:
- planes are returning from the war mission
- someone recommended to protect the most damaged places of them
- taking survivor bias into account leads to a conclusion that it's better to protect the undamaged places
- because the planes that actually returned were not hit in the vital places
