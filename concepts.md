**How to correctly namespace things?**

1. Make names easy to sort and digest while listing:

```
uploads_mlekolandia
uploads_maslolandia
uploads_jogurtolandia
```

instead of

```
mlekolandia_uploads
maslolandia_uploads
jogurtolandia_uploads
```

2. The date format that makes the most sense (the same two benefits as above):

```
2019-08-01
2019-08-02
2019-08-02
```
