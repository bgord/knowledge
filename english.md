**will vs going to vs present continuous**

"Going to" is a bit more relaxed than "will".

If you make a decision about doing something in the moment of speaking, not before the conversation, use "will". [x]
- What will you bring to the party?
- I'll bring some beer.

If a decision was made before the conversation, use "going to".
- Jack is going to bring some beer.

"Going to" in most cases is interchangeable with present continuous.

Present continuous is mainly used for arrangements/plans with specific time and date.
- Do you want to come to the party on Sunday afternoon?
- Sorry, I can't. I'm playing football at 3 PM.

If you are basing your prediction on current evidence, use "going to".
- Look at that black cloud, it's going to rain!

What are you going tomorrow? (to get to know somebody's availability)

If you want to state a future fact, use "will".
- I will be on plane tomorrow.

**tiny vs small**

"Small" (more formal) = little
"Tiny" (more informal) = very little

E.g.
"Wait, I'm almost done, there's just a tiny bit left!"
(Would be a bit unnatural to say 'just a small bit left' in this case.)

VS

"Your house is small but it's very cosy."
(To say 'your house is tiny' to a stranger might seem like you're making fun of the size of their house.)
